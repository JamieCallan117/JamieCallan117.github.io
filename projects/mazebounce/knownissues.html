            <p>This page contains all of the known issues for the game Maze Bounce as of the date above. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>On some devices, dragging a corner does not line up with touch input.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is purely visual and ending the drag action still places the corner on the position where the input stopped. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Sometimes the ball will go through walls and/or escape the maze.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The game should detect if the ball escapes the mazes and stop movement automatically and whenever a wall is hit the movement will also be stopped automatically.</li>
                    <li>Whenever a wall is hit or the ball is detected as being outside the maze a check will occur to see if you have correctly placed all corners and if so a panel will appear to notify you of the issue and you will be given the choice to try the level again or to just complete it. You will also be able to choose if this panel should appear every time the issue happens or to just automatically complete the level.</li>
                    <li>It usually occurs on lower end devices running the game below 60fps but it may also occur on other devices.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>A corner will get stuck floating above the maze.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I've only ever encountered this bug in the Unity Editor whilst testing the app so it may not be an issue on mobile but I'll put it here anyway.</li>
                    <li>Unfortunately, the only way to solve this is to reset the level you are currently on and hope it doesn't happen again. If it has only happened to one corner, you can try and position it so the floating corner is where you want it to be placed on the maze and the ball will still hit it and correctly bounce.</li>
                    <li>If you are able to consistently reproduce this issue then please let me know.</li>
