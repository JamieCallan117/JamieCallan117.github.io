         <h1>CC-117</h1>
         <div class="content">
            <p>This is a Discord bot I made for my Wynncraft Guild. It reads
               data from the Wynncraft public API and uses that to perform
               various different features.
            </p>
            <p>The bot started out as a way to automatically apply roles in
               the Discord server based on their in-game stats, so if they
               had the Chief rank in the Guild, they would be given the Chief
               rank in the Discord server.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/CC-117/UpdateRanks.png" alt="The bot sending a message on how many members have had their roles updated.">
            <p>After looking more into the API, I thought of some more features
               that could be included in the bot. So the next feature I implemented
               was the ability to track other guilds and get a rough idea on how
               many players each guild had online at a time.
            </p>
            <p>This would get the current number of players online and calculate
               the running average over the course of a week before resetting the
               running average but using the average at the end of the previous
               week as a starting point.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/CC-117/TrackedGuilds.png" alt="The bot responding to the trackedguilds command.">
            <p>The next feature was an extension of tracking guilds and it tried to
               find the most and least active hours for a guild, those being when
               they had the most or least players online in the last 24 hours.
            </p>
            <p>The bot would display the information in the timezone you selected in
               the command and every hour in the last 24 where they had the most and
               least players online. It would also display the average number of players
               online who had either the Captain role or a role above that.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/CC-117/ActiveHours.png" alt="The bot responding to the activehours command.">
            <p>The most recent feature I've added is to see how long it has been since
               every member in a guild logged in. It displays the username, guild rank
               and how many days it has been since the user logged in. If they are
               currently online, then it will say that.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/CC-117/LastLogins.png" alt="The bot responding to the lastlogins command.">
            <p>
               As our guild has a threshold for how long you can be inactive before being
               removed from the guild, viewing the last logins for our guild will
               highlight members green if they are fine and red if they should be
               removed from the guild.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/CC-117/LastLoginsHOC.png" alt="The bot responding to the lastlogins command for our guild.">
            <p>
               Currently the bot has a few things hardcoded for our guilds Discord
               server so a lot of the functionality wouldn't work on other servers,
               but I am actively trying to make improvements towards that to hopefully
               allow it to be on multiple servers.
            </p>
            <p>
               I also hope to improve the data storage system as currently it is all
               stored in text files and I would like it to be stored in a database
               instead.
            </p>
            <p>
               I originally created the bot in Python, but when I decided to allow
               for slash commands to be used I swapped to using Java, in the future 
               I may rewrite the bot in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>The GitHub repository for the bot is 
               available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;"; href="https://github.com/JamieCallan117/CC-117"><u>here</u></a>.
