        <div class="content">
            <p> This is a Discord bot I made for my Wynncraft Guild. It reads data from the Wynncraft public API and uses that to perform various different features. </p>
            <p> The bot started out as a way to automatically apply roles in the Discord server based on their in-game stats, so if they had the Chief rank in the Guild, they would be given the Chief rank in the Discord server. </p> <img src="/Resources/CC-117/UpdateRanks.png" alt="The bot sending a message on how many members have had their roles updated.">
            <p> After looking more into the API, I thought of some more features that could be included in the bot. So the next feature I implemented was the ability to track other guilds and get a rough idea on how many players each guild had online at a time. </p>
            <p> This would keep track of a running average of the players online over the course of a week and also how many of those players had the rank of captain or above. It also displays the same information but for how many are currently online, instead of the average. </p> <img src="/Resources/CC-117/TrackedGuilds.png" alt="The bot responding to the trackedguilds command.">
            <p> The next feature was an extension of tracking guilds and it tried to find the most and least active hours for a guild, those being when they had the most or least players online in the last 24 hours. </p>
            <p> The bot would display the average number of online players and online captains at each hour for the last week. It also allows you to change what timezone this information is displayed in, as by default it shows in UTC. </p> <img src="/Resources/CC-117/ActiveHours.png" alt="The bot responding to the activehours command.">
            <p> The most recent feature I've added is to see how long it has been since every member in a guild logged in. It displays the username, guild rank and how many days it has been since the user logged in. If they are currently online, then it will say that. </p> <img src="/Resources/CC-117/LastLogins.png" alt="The bot responding to the lastlogins command.">
            <p> You can also set in your config file the threshold for each rank and how long they are allowed to be inactive for before they will be removed from the guild. When a member is over the threshold they will be highlighted in red, otherwise they will be highlighted green. This will only work if the guild you are checking the last logins for is the guild your server represents. </p> <img src="/Resources/CC-117/LastLoginsHOC.png" alt="The bot responding to the lastlogins command for our guild.">
            <p> Some guilds have the same name and/or prefix but with different capitilisation, so in these cases the bot will present the options of which guild you meant and you can click one of the buttons to make the choice. </p> <img src="/Resources/CC-117/MultipleGuilds.png" alt="The bot displaying a list of possible guilds given the prefix pun.">
            <p> There also exists a command /viewconfig to easily see all of the configurations you have made to the bot so if you want to see what you set an option as, you can simply run this command to see if the option is already set to what you want. </p> <img src="/Resources/CC-117/ViewConfig.png" alt="The bot displaying a user friendly version of the config file for the current server.">
            <p> I originally wrote the bot in Python when it was simply just updating roles but as I wanted to add more features I swapped to Java to support slash commands and later when I wanted to swap to using a database rather than text files I rewrote the bot in JavaScript. </p>
            <p> The bot currently supports multiple Discord servers as each has their own config file, however I am still currently testing it on my own guild's server to ensure everything works properly as there is 1 big issue I will need to fix before allowing others to invite it to their own servers. </p>
            <p> The bot runs some functions on intervals to update the database and at the moment, this causes the bot to be unable to respond to user commands whilst it is running, my idea for fixing this is to seperate the program in 2, one being the bot reading from the database and the other is the program updating the database. For now, I just want to make sure everything else works before tackling this issue. </p>
            <p>The GitHub repository for the new JavaScript bot is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/JamieCallan117/CC-117"><u>here</u></a>. </p>
            <p>The GitHub repository for the old Java bot is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/JamieCallan117/CC-117-legacy-"><u>here</u></a>. </p>
