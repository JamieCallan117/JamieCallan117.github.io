          <p>This project was a game jam made by some friends. I did not
            participate in the original development but I later added simple
            multiplayer to it so that you could play with 4 players online.</p>
            <img src="/Resources/BallsAndMines/BallsAndMines.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the game in progress with 2 players.">
            <p>Whilst I did not participate in the development of the
              original game as I had not yet started my University module
              on Unity, I did pitch ideas for what the game would be based
              on the given theme, so I knew how the game worked at a
              surface level, but as for the code I had not seen it prior to my
              addition.</p>
              <p>The multiplayer lobby presents you with two text boxes, one
                for your username and the other for the room you want to
                join/create. After clicking the join/create button you will
                either join the existing room, or create one with the specified
                name. Afterwards, you can choose to start the game once all
                players have joined.</p>
            <img src="/Resources/BallsAndMines/BallsAndMinesLobby.png" alt="A screenshot of the multiplayer lobby with 2 players having joined.">
            <p>The tanks on the map will target the closest player to them, <br>
              the mines will explode on everyones client and once one player <br>
              dies, the round will be over for everyone as you all have to <br>
              make it to the end of the level.</p>
            <img src="/Resources/BallsAndMines/BallsAndMinesDeath.png" alt="A screenshot of the screen when a player has died.">
            <p>I looked up ways to implement multiplayer into Unity and found
              a tutorial for using PUN (Photon Unity Networking) and followed
              those for creating the implementation of multiplayer into the
              game. As it was using Unity, I wrote the code in C#.</p>
            <p>The GitHub repository for the game is 
              available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;"; href="https://github.com/JoeSubbi/Balls-and-Mines"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
