            <p>Artemis is a rewrite of the Minecraft mod Wynntils for modern versions of the game. I have made a few contributions to the mod. Some are ports from the original mod, some are new features. </p>
            <p>The mod had been released in an Alpha state with a lot of the basics from the original mod, known as legacy, implemented. However, there was a lot from legacy that was yet to be ported over. Over the next few months, features were ported over from various different contributors. </p>
            <p> One feature that was missing that I missed having was the waypoint manager, which allowed easy access for viewing and editing your custom waypoints. Currently, the only way to view and edit them was to navigate the map and locate them, then use different input methods to edit or delete them. </p>
            <p>The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1382"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <p> The second feature I worked on is another port from the original mod. The server uses a Minecraft container screen to display various items that can be purchased, in this case <q>passes</q> to travel over the ocean to different islands. </p>
            <p> This feature replaced that screen with an overhead map of the world that you can use the mouse to pan the view and see all the possible locations you can travel to. It also adds extra features such as being able to see inaccessible locations and drawing a line between locations. </p>
            <p> The feature can be toggled on and off via the in-game config. </p>
            <p>The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1473"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <p> The third feature is essentially the same as the previous, just as an alternative screen. Instead of clicking the area on the map you wanted to travel to, you instead select the destination via a <q>departure board</q> located to the left of the map. </p>
            <p> The in-game config allows users to choose whether they want this screen or the basic map screen. Or disable the custom screen entirely. </p>

            <p> The fourth feature I added was another port from the original mod, this time adding a <q>filled arc</q> around an in-game item known as an Emerald Pouch. </p>
            <p> An Emerald Pouch allows players to store a large amount of emeralds on them at once. Different tiers allow players to store different amounts, with higher tiers giving more capacity. </p>
            <p> Like previous features, the in-game config allows users to choose whether this feature is enabled or not and they can also choose whether the arc will only be rendered on their hotbar or in their inventory. </p>
            <p> This feature adds an arc around the item to show how full it is, a small green arc means there is still a lot of space left, a red almost complete arc means it is nearly full. </p>
            <p>The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1549"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <p> This is the first open source project I have contributed to so it has definitely helped me to have a better understanding on working on a bigger project and the process to go through getting a feature merged. </p>
            <p> There are still a few more features that need porting from the original mod I may work on, but I also have some ideas for new features that I may try to implement. </p>
