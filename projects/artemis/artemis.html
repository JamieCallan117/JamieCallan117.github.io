        <h1>Artemis</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Artemis is a rewrite of the Minecraft mod Wynntils for modern versions of the game. I have made a few contributions to the mod. Some are ports from the original mod, some are new features. </p>
            <p>The mod had been released in an Alpha state with a lot of the basics from the original mod, known as legacy, implemented. However, there was a lot from legacy that was yet to be ported over. Over the next few months, features were ported over from various different contributors. </p>
            <p> One feature that was missing that I missed having was the waypoint manager, which allowed easy access for viewing and editing your custom waypoints. Currently, the only way to view and edit them was to navigate the map and locate them, then use different input methods to edit or delete them. </p>
            <p>The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1382"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <p> The second feature I worked on is another port from the original mod. The server uses a Minecraft container screen to display various items that can be purchased, in this case <q>passes</q> to travel over the ocean to different islands. </p>
            <p> This feature replaced that screen with an overhead map of the world that you can use the mouse to pan the view and see all the possible locations you can travel to. It also adds extra features such as being able to see inaccessible locations and drawing a line between locations. </p>
            <p> The feature can be toggled on and off via the in-game config. </p>
            <p>The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1473"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <p> The third feature is essentially the same as the previous, just as an alternative screen. Instead of clicking the area on the map you wanted to travel to, you instead select the destination via a <q>departure board</q> located to the left of the map. </p>
            <p> The in-game config allows users to choose whether they want this screen or the basic map screen. Or disable the custom screen entirely. </p>

            <p> The fourth feature I added was another port from the original mod, this time adding a <q>filled arc</q> around an in-game item known as an Emerald Pouch. </p>
            <p> An Emerald Pouch allows players to store a large amount of emeralds on them at once. Different tiers allow players to store different amounts, with higher tiers giving more capacity. </p>
            <p> Like previous features, the in-game config allows users to choose whether this feature is enabled or not and they can also choose whether the arc will only be rendered on their hotbar or in their inventory. </p>
            <p> This feature adds an arc around the item to show how full it is, a small green arc means there is still a lot of space left, a red almost complete arc means it is nearly full. </p>
            <p>The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1549"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <p> The fifth feature I've added to the mod is displaying your guild rank and name in the Wynntils book screen. </p>
            <p> The Wynntils book screen is a custom GUI screen which is used to edit the config for the mod and better display some information from the server, such as a custom quest list UI. </p>
            <p> This feature simply adds the rank for your current guild as well as the name of that guild to the book. It gets the information from reading the <q>lore</q> of an item in the compass menu which is read each time the player logs in to the server. </p>
            <p> At the time of writing this, the server is preparing for the release of version 2.0.3 which will break some of the mods functionality so whilst the feature is ready, it will not be merged into the mod until after all the issues with the new release have been handled. </p>
            <p>The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1652"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <p> The sixth feature that I have contributed to the mod is custom quick jump bank pages. </p>
            <p> The banks on the server contain multiple pages that you can navigate between one at a time with next/previous buttons, however it also features some quick jump buttons at certain intervals, those being 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21. </p>
            <p> This feature allows users to customise those buttons to jump to a different page and also display a clear icon so you know that there are buttons to be clicked there, instead of the default texture not indiciating that well. </p>
            <p> Since the mod cannot change which page the quick jump buttons will jump to, it instead calculates the quickest path to the custom selected page and uses a combination of the hard coded destinations for the quick jump buttons and the next/previous buttons to get to the desired page. It will then click those buttons for you to get to the page you want. </p>
            <p> Like the previous feature, this feature is not going to be merged until the server has been updated. However, this feature still has some potential improvements to be made from reviews on the pull request. </p>
            <p>The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1670"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <p> This is the first open source project I have contributed to so it has definitely helped me to have a better understanding on working on a bigger project and the process to go through getting a feature merged. </p>
            <p> There are still a few more features that need porting from the original mod I may work on, but I also have some ideas for new features that I may try to implement. </p>
