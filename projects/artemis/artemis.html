        <h1>Artemis</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p> Artemis is a rewrite of the Minecraft mod Wynntils for modern versions of the game. I started out porting a feature from the original mod that was yet to be added and eventually added more over time to the point where I was asked to join the official development team. </p>
            <p> The mod was originally released in an alpha state with many features missing from the original but a lot of the framework existed for them to be added. Over time, many of these features were ported from different contributors and also some new features not present in the original were added. </p>

            <h3 id="feature-one">Feature One - Waypoint Manager</h3>
            <p> One feature that was missing that I missed having was the waypoint manager, which allowed easy access for viewing and editing your custom waypoints. Currently, the only way to view and edit them was to navigate the map and locate them, then use different input methods to edit or delete them. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1382"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <h3 id="feature-two">Feature Two - Seaskipper Map</h3>
            <p> The second feature I worked on is another port from the original mod. The server uses a Minecraft container screen to display various items that can be purchased, in this case <q>passes</q> to travel over the ocean to different islands. </p>
            <p> This feature replaced that screen with an overhead map of the world that you can use the mouse to pan the view and see all the possible locations you can travel to. It also adds extra features such as being able to see inaccessible locations and drawing a line between locations. </p>
            <p> The feature can be toggled on and off via the in-game config. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1473"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            </video>
            <h3 id="feature-three">Feature Three - Seaskipper Departure Board</h3>
            <p> The third feature is essentially the same as the previous, just as an alternative screen. Instead of clicking the area on the map you wanted to travel to, you instead select the destination via a <q>departure board</q> located to the left of the map. </p>
            <p> The in-game config allows users to choose whether they want this screen or the basic map screen. Or disable the custom screen entirely. </p>

            <h3 id="feature-four">Feature Four - Emerald Pouch Fill Arc</h3>
            <p> The fourth feature I added was another port from the original mod, this time adding a <q>filled arc</q> around an in-game item known as an Emerald Pouch. </p>
            <p> An Emerald Pouch allows players to store a large amount of emeralds on them at once. Different tiers allow players to store different amounts, with higher tiers giving more capacity. </p>
            <p> Like previous features, the in-game config allows users to choose whether this feature is enabled or not and they can also choose whether the arc will only be rendered on their hotbar or in their inventory. </p>
            <p> This feature adds an arc around the item to show how full it is, a small green arc means there is still a lot of space left, a red almost complete arc means it is nearly full. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1549"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <h3 id="feature-five">Feature Five - Guild Name and Rank in Content Book</h3>
            <p> The fifth feature I've added to the mod is displaying your guild rank and name in the Wynntils book screen. </p>
            <p> The Wynntils book screen is a custom GUI screen which is used to edit the config for the mod and better display some information from the server, such as a custom quest list UI. </p>
            <p> This feature simply adds the rank for your current guild as well as the name of that guild to the book. It gets the information from reading the <q>lore</q> of an item in the compass menu which is read each time the player logs in to the server. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1652"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <h3 id="feature-six">Feature Six - Custom Bank Quick Jump Buttons</h3>
            <p> The sixth feature that I have contributed to the mod is custom quick jump bank pages. </p>
            <p> The banks on the server contain multiple pages that you can navigate between one at a time with next/previous buttons, however it also features some quick jump buttons at certain intervals, those being 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21. </p>
            <p> This feature allows users to customise those buttons to jump to a different page and also display a clear icon so you know that there are buttons to be clicked there, instead of the default texture not indiciating that well. </p>
            <p> Since the mod cannot change which page the quick jump buttons will jump to, it instead calculates the quickest path to the custom selected page and uses a combination of the hard coded destinations for the quick jump buttons and the next/previous buttons to get to the desired page. It will then click those buttons for you to get to the page you want. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1670"><u>here</u></a>. </p>
            <p> I also released a fix for an issue I found shortly after the feature was merged. The pull request for the fix is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1753"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <h3 id="feature-seven">Feature Seven - Scrolling Support for Bookshelf</h3>
            <p> The seventh feature was a very simple one, that just added the newly released bookshelf container as an option for the scrollable containers. It was also useful to have for the next feature I added. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1734"><u>here</u></a>. </p>
            <h3 id="feature-eight">Feature Eight - Custom Bookshelf & Misc. Bucket Quick Jump Buttons</h3>
            <p> The eighth feature that I have contributed to the mod is essentially the same as the sixth, but for the other two containers on the server that use quick jump buttons. </p>
            <p> The other two containers only feature a maximum of ten pages and they still keep the same default jump destinations as the bank, so by default the feature will change the locations to more appropriate options however the user can still customise them to whatever they want in the range of one to ten. </p>
            <p> When I first made the pull request, I knew having the same code essentially duplicated for two more features was a bad idea, but I also wanted to avoid having eighteen configuration options and so I was suggested to convert the config options to use string arrays and parse those to integers. </p>
            <p> Since it uses string arrays as the input, it will attempt to parse those to integers and any that are outside of the range for available pages, it will round them to 1 or the max pages. If you add more than six inputs, it will truncate and anything less than six will be populated with values from the default as substitutes. Failing to parse an integer will result in the default destinations being used. </p>

            <h3 id="feature-nine">Feature Nine - Custom Block Bank Quick Jump Buttons</h3>
            <p> The ninth feature that I added was again, basically the same as feature six and eight but for another container that also features jump buttons. </p>
            <p> This container has some unique properties however, as unlike the others it has two modes, personal and island storage. Personal storage works just like the other containers, but island storage is unique for each housing island you have. </p>
            <p> This feature does not have support for different jump pages in each of the different containers, only 1 generic custom set. However, in the future I plan to add a system so that the different housing islands can be detected, allowing for custom jump pages for each island. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1788"><u>here</u></a>. </p>
            <h3 id="feature-ten">Feature Ten - Gavellian and Wynnic Transcription</h3>
            <p> The tenth feature that I've added allows you to send messages and understand what other players & NPC's are saying in the two in-game languages, High Gavellian and Ancient Wynnic. </p>
            <p> There are two input methods, either you select a button for the language you want to type in, or you surround the text you want to be transcribed in brackets, [[]] for Wynnic and &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; for Gavellian. </p>
            <p> If you don't use the brackets system, the mod will automatically replace your input with the alternative in your selected language if it exists. Since Wynnic supports numbers, it will also convert your input as you type, so 1 will remain as 1, but if you type a 0 after then it will become 10. This has a cap of 5,000 as 100 is the largest supported character in Wynnic, so numbers past 100 can get long very quickly. </p>
            <p> When you receive a chat message or NPC dialogue, that will also be transcribed if it contains Gavellian or Wynnic. </p>
            <p> There are 3 conditions to pick from when the languages should be transcribed, these are: Always, When you have completed the discovery granting you the transcriber and if you have the transcriber in your inventory. You can also choose for it to never be transcribed. </p>
            <p> You can also choose to have transcriptions be coloured or not, so you know what was Gavellian or Wynnic. </p>

            <h3 id="feature-eleven">Feature Eleven - Export Waypoints</h3>
            <p> The eleventh feature that I implemented was an export button to the waypoint manager. Another contributor added an import button so that users could more easily migrate from the old version of the mod to this new version, but they did not add an export button. </p>
            <p> The feature simply converts the data for all of your custom waypoints into a JSON string and copies it to your clipboard, ready to be shared with others. </p>
            <p> Whilst working on this, I also changed the import method to only import new waypoints, so any waypoints that you already have won't be imported. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1903"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <h3 id="feature-twelve">Feature Twelve - Transcription Tooltips</h3>
            <p> For my twelth addition, I added a tooltip to transcribed text so that you know it was transcribed and you can also see the original message before it was transcribed. </p>
            <p> I also added the option for the transcription to be displayed only in the tooltip, so the message you see will still remain the same, but hovering over it will display the transcribed text. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1961"><u>here</u></a>. </p>
            <p> I also released a fix for an issue I found shortly after the feature was merged. The pull request for the fix is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1975"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <h3 id="feature-thirteen">Feature Thirteen - Armour and Accessory durability functions</h3>
            <p> My thirteenth contribution to the mod was adding durability functions to armour and accessories. </p>
            <p> In the game, you can craft armour and accessories and these will have durability, unlike regular items. But, you have to hover over them in your inventory to be able to see what their durability values are. There has existed a function for displaying the durability of an item in your hand for some time, but there was not any for your armour or accessories. </p>

            <h3 id="feature-fourteen">Feature Fourteen - Custom Bank Page Names</h3>
            <p> The fourteenth feature that I've added to the mod is the ability to set a custom name for your various different types of bank. </p>
            <p> This feature also extends into the quick jump buttons feature by displaying the name of the target page on the button, so you have a better idea of where it is you want to go. </p>
            <p> It supports all of the current bank styled containers, those being bank, block bank, bookshelf and misc bucket. </p>

            <h3 id="feature-fifteen">Feature Fifteen - Per Character Guild Contribution</h3>
            <p> For my fifteenth addition I added a new feature not present in the original mod, which was having unique guild contribution amounts for each of your characters. </p>
            <p> In Wynncraft you can join a guild and to level up your guild, members must contribute XP. By default, Wynn contributes 0% but by running a command you can choose to contribute up to 100% of your XP. </p>
            <p> Since the level cap for the game is 106, after that point XP is useless so many players contribute 100% of their XP at that point, however if you then swap to a character below level 106 it will not update your contribution amount as it is global, so this feature will remember if you ran the contribute command on a character and next time you load that character it will automatically run the contribute command, this way you can switch between characters without having to run the command manually every time.  </p>

            <p> After the feature was merged, a suggestion was made for a better way to implement the feature so I later followed up with that.

            </video>
            <h3 id="feature-sixteen">Feature Sixteen - Rarity and Quality Filters</h3>
            <p> The next feature was a small part of a larger system that was being worked on by another developer which was an advanced filtering system for our guides screen but also for banks. </p>
            <p> The system allowed users to filter the guide/banks by various different stats and attributes, the two I added with this feature allowed filtering by quality of a material/ingredient which can either be a quality tier of 0, 1, 2 or 3. And also sorting gear by their rarity, which can be common, rare, set, fabled, legendary or mythic. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/2069"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <img src="/Resources/Artemis/RarityAndQualityFilters.png" alt="A screenshot of the guide screen with quality and rarity filters active.">
            <h3 id="feature-seventeen">Feature Seventeen - Scrolling in Guild Member List</h3>
            <p> I then added the ability to scroll in the guild member list screen, another very simply feature similar to adding scrolling support for the bookshelf in feature seven. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/2076"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            <h3 id="feature-eighteen">Feature Eighteen - Highlight Duplicate Cosmetics</h3>
            <p> For my next addition I added the ability to see duplicate cosmetics in the scrap menu. </p>
            <p> On Wynncraft you can get cosmetic items in crates, however they are not unique and you can get multiple of the same cosmetic. To account for this, you can scrap 5 of the same rarity cosmetics in exchange for 1 cosmetic of a higher rarity. </p>
            <p> Since some people only like to scrap cosmetics they have more than 1 of, this feature allows you to see if you have any duplicates of a cosmetic by hovering it, or selecting it to be scrapped. Hovering it will show duplicates in a blue ring and selected cosmetic duplicates in an orange ring. However the user can change the logic in the config to only highlight hovered or selected duplicates but the default is both. </p>
            <p> This feature was originally from the legacy version of the mod, however it only had support for hovering cosmetics, I believe this is an improvement as not all cosmetics are displayed at once so this allows you to see duplicates on all pages. </p>
            <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/2135"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

            </video>
            <p> This is the first open source project I have contributed to so it has definitely helped me to have a better understanding on working on a bigger project and the process to go through getting a feature merged. </p>
            <p> Since I have now become an official member of the development team, I also have more experience working on a larger project as a team member since I can easily communicate with the other developers and I am more accustomed to reviewing others code. </p>
