            <p>Artemis is a rewrite of the Minecraft mod Wynntils for modern
               versions of the game. I have made a few contributions to the
               mod. So far these are ports of features from the original mod.
            </p>
            <p>The mod had been released in an Alpha state with a lot of the basics from
               the original mod, known as legacy, implemented. However, there was a lot
               from legacy that was yet to be ported over. Over the next few months,
               features were ported over from various different contributors.
            </p>
            <p>
               One feature that was missing that I missed having was the waypoint manager,
               which allowed easy access for viewing and editing your custom waypoints.
               Currently, the only way to view and edit them was to navigate the map and
               locate them, then use different input methods to edit or delete them.

            <p>The second feature I worked on is yet to be merged into the main branch
               as one of the main devs wanted to rewrite part of the code but what I
               originally wrote did work.
            </p>
            <p>
               The server uses a Minecraft container screen to display various
               items that can be purchased, in this case <q>passes</q> to travel over
               the ocean to different islands.
            </p>
            <p>
               This feature replaced that screen with an overhead map of the world that you
               can use the mouse to pan the view and see all the possible locations you can
               travel to. It also adds extra features such as being able to see inaccessible
               locations and drawing a line between locations.
            </p>
            <p>
               The feature can be toggled on and off via the in-game config.

            <p>
               This is the first open source project I have contributed to so it has definitely
               helped me to have a better understanding on working on a bigger project and
               the process to go through getting a feature merged.
            </p>
            <p>
               I do currently have at least 1 more feature planned to implement, which is an
               alternative screen for the above feature, where instead of clicking on the map
               to select your location, there will be a <q>departure board</q> of all locations
               displayed to the left of the screen and the map will be on the right of the screen
               and update to the location of the selected destination as you click each button.
            </p>
            <p>
               I do have a lot of this feature complete, but am currently awaiting for the other
               dev to finish the rewrite of some of my code from the original feature.
