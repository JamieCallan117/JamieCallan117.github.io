<div class="project">
  <p>This was my final year project for my Software Engineering <br>
    course at Swansea University. I recreated the board game <br>
    Codenames as an Android application with a strong focus <br>
    on accessibility.</p>
  <img src="/Codenames.jpg" width="600" height="285">
  <p>Codenames is played with 2 teams of players, both having a <br>
    minimum of 2 members. One member per team is assigned <br>
    the role of 'spymaster' whilst every other member is simply <br>
    just a regular player.
  </p>
  <img src="/CodenamesTeamSetup.jpg" width="600" height="285">
  <p>Once the teams have been setup and you start the game, <br>
    you will be presented with the board which contains 25 <br>
    unique words all assigned to one of 4 colours. By default <br>
    these are blue for team A, red for team B, a light green for <br>
    neutral and black for the bomb word.</p>
  <p>To play the game, the starting teams spymaster must find a <br>
    word that links to as many of the words coloured with their <br>
    teams colour. For example, if their team has the words "file" <br>
    and "root" you could give the hint "directory" as that relates <br>
    to both words. To indiciate to your team how many words they <br>
    have to choose, you must also give a number along with the <br>
    word, in this case 2.</p>
  <img src="/CodenamesGuess.jpg" width="600" height="285">
  <p>After a hint has been given, the other members of the team <br>
    must select which words they think the hint relates to. They <br>
    are allowed to guess 1 more than the number given, so if the <br>
    hint relates to 2 words, 3 guesses can be made.</p>
  <p>However, you aren't allowed to freely guess as guessing a <br>
    word belonging to the other team or a neutral word will end <br>
    your teams turn early and clicking the bomb word will instantly <br>
    end the game with your loss.</p>
  <p>After your team completes your turn, the opposing teams <br>
    spymaster must now give a hint for their team and the cycle <br>
    repeats until either the bomb word is clicked, or one team <br>
    successfully clicks all of their words.</p>
  <p>The game features two ways to play, either as a replacement <br>
    to the board game or you can play online with friends. If you <br>
    choose to play locally then you can select team members to <br>
    make it easier to remember whos team everyone is on, or <br>
    you can play without setting up teams. You then pass the <br>
    device around your group dependent on who the current game <br>
    phase applies too.</p>
  <p>The online version of the game can be played on your own <br>
    device and allows you to play with people not in the same <br>
    room as you. The game still functions the same but now <br>
    includes a chat option to communicate with team members.</p>
  <img src="/CodenamesOnline.jpg" width="600" height="285">
  <p>For the accessibility features in the game, I chose to go <br>
    with Text-to-Speech and customising colours. The <br>
    Text-to-Speech is triggered by performing a held press on <br>
    an element that has text associated with it, so a button or <br>
    just plain text for example. This will then read the text out <br>
    to the user.</p>
  <p>As for customising colours, you have free control over the <br>
    colour of 8 different categories in the app. These are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Team A</li>
      <li>Team B</li>
      <li>Bomb Square</li>
      <li>Neutral Square</li>
      <li>Unmodified Square</li>
      <li>Application Background</li>
      <li>Menu Buttons</li>
      <li>Menu Text</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are 3 available slots to save different combinations <br>
    of colours.</p>
    <img src="/CodenamesColours.jpg" width="600" height="285">
  <hr style="width:35%">
  <p>I initially started by created designs for how each scene <br>
    in the app would look and then I created that using XML in <br>
    Android Studio. Afterwards I created basic code in Kotlin <br>
    for navigating through the different scenes, testing that <br>
    every piece of code I wrote worked as intended as I went.</p>
  <p>The server to connect the devices together for online play <br>
    was written in JavaScript using the Node.js framework. <br>
    Whilst is certainly has room for improvement, given that <br>
    it was self taught due to JavaScript not being taught at my <br>
    University I think it works very well.</p>
  <p>The GitHub repository for the Android application is 
    <br>available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;"; href="https://github.com/JamieCallan117/AccessibleCodenames"><u>here</u></a>
    and the server is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;"; href="https://github.com/JamieCallan117/AccessibleCodenamesServer"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
