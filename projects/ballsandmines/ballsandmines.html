            <p>This project was a game jam made by some friends. I did not participate in the original development but I later added simple multiplayer to it so that you could play with 4 players online. </p> <img src="/Resources/BallsAndMines/BallsAndMines.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the game in progress with 2 players.">
            <p>Whilst I did not participate in the development of the original game as I had not yet started my University module on Unity, I did pitch ideas for what the game would be based on the given theme, so I knew how the game worked at a surface level, but as for the code I had not seen it prior to my addition. </p>
            <p>The multiplayer lobby presents you with two text boxes, one for your username and the other for the room you want to join/create. After clicking the join/create button you will either join the existing room, or create one with the specified name. Afterwards, you can choose to start the game once all players have joined. </p> <img src="/Resources/BallsAndMines/BallsAndMinesLobby.png" alt="A screenshot of the multiplayer lobby with 2 players having joined.">
            <p>The tanks on the map will target the closest player to them, <br> the mines will explode on everyones client and once one player <br> dies, the round will be over for everyone as you all have to <br> make it to the end of the level. </p> <img src="/Resources/BallsAndMines/BallsAndMinesDeath.png" alt="A screenshot of the screen when a player has died.">
            <p>I looked up ways to implement multiplayer into Unity and found a tutorial for using PUN (Photon Unity Networking) and followed those for creating the implementation of multiplayer into the game. As it was using Unity, I wrote the code in C#. </p>
            <p>The GitHub repository for the game is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/JoeSubbi/Balls-and-Mines"><u>here</u></a>. </p>
